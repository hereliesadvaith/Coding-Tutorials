# Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It was created to help developers build web applications quickly and efficiently, taking care of much of the hassle associated with web development.

To install django
```bash
pip install django
```

To start project in current folder
```bash
django-admin startproject backend .
